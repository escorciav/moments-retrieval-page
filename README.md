## Finding Moments of Interest From Multiple Videos

Hi there! This is the landing page of our academic work [_Temporal Localization of Moments in Video Collections with Natural Language_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12763).

Are you working in this area? Please sign up by hitting the ‚≠ê button in the [Github banner](https://github.com/escorciav/moments-retrieval-page). We will be releasing a preliminary version of the code and features within the next couple of weeks.

If you are attending ICCV, say hi to the members of our team [Bryan Russell](http://bryanrussell.org/) and [Josef Sivic](https://www.di.ens.fr/~josef/).
